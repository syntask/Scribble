# Scribble
Scribble is a screensaver for Mac OS inspired by the art style of Nurture by Porter Robinson.
Upon loading, a random scribble will be drawn in three dimensional space and slowly rotated around the vertical axis. 
The animation is drawn to an offscreen buffer at a lower resolution then scaled up without anti-aliasing to give it a pixelated, crunchy aesthetic. 
Written in Coco/Objective-C.
